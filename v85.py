'''Potential To-Dos

--------------
- (((CURRENTLY IMPOSSIBLE TODO: ideally the 2nd choice would not include the country/entity of the first
choice (currently when you choose the same country/entity twice, the program will just exit)
o I tried it by using blacklistRegex but it did not work because it did complains that "blacklistRegexes" ist not defined:
result = pyip.inputStr('Favorite animal> ', blacklistRegexes=['moose'])_30.4.22
o I also tried to create a list and let pyip make use of the list, which die not work either because it did not recognize the list_30.4.22)))
